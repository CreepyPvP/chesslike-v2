# Notes

This document contains notes, meant for myself, on how to approach the rewrite of this project

- Data orientation: Think first about which data should represent a gamestate, then think about functions. Functions are only a "glue", mere transformation of the data, nothing more.
- Solve the problem at hand the simplest way possible. Don't overgeneralize, Don't overengineer. Just. Solve. The. Problem.
- Ecs are awesome
- OOP sucks
- Try using cpp
